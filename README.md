# Machine Learning Concepts from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning concepts built from scratch using only Python and libraries like `NumPy`. The goal is to provide a clear, hands-on understanding of how common machine learning algorithms and techniques work under the hood.

## Features

- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: Implementations of classification and regression algorithms such as Decision Trees, Linear Regression, etc.
- **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**: Implementations of clustering algorithms like K-Means, PCA, etc.
- **Evaluation Techniques**: Methods like Cross-Validation, Information Gain, Entropy, etc.
- **Core Machine Learning Concepts**: Concepts like Entropy, Information Gain, Gradient Descent, PCA, etc., all implemented from scratch.

## Installation

To use the code, you’ll need `Python` and `NumPy`. If you haven't installed `NumPy`, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
Alternatively, you can clone this repository and run the code directly:
```
git clone https://github.com/SghairiYoussef/ML_Concepts_from_scratch.git
cd ML_Concepts_from_scratch
```

**Key Files:**
algorithms/: Contains implementations of machine learning algorithms.
evaluation/: Functions that evaluate model performance, such as cross-validation.
utils/: Helper functions for data manipulation, such as normalization and entropy calculation.

For any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
